# Night Mode 

The code includes two methods, one based on the RGB channel values of the image and the other using bright channel obtained from the image.
The latter has been commented out.

The path to the image can be provided via user input.
Or you can unncomment the ```# path = 'D:/Projects/Night_Mode/8.jpg'``` line to add the path in the code itself.

To run the script:
```!python nightmode.py```
